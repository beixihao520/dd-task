## Status: ✅ Success

## Analysis Plan
**Intents:** 5
**Rationale:** The analysis plan aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of customer satisfaction and loyalty, identify key drivers of satisfaction and dissatisfaction, and pinpoint segments that require attention. By analyzing NPS, satisfaction levels, feature usage, and demographic patterns, we can uncover actionable insights that inform product improvements and strategic decisions. The plan focuses on understanding regional differences, subscription plan impacts, feature usage correlations, tenure effects, and identifying at-risk customers, which are crucial for enhancing customer experience and retention.
