## Status: ✅ Success

## Analysis Plan
**Intents:** 5
**Rationale:** The analysis plan aims to provide actionable insights into customer satisfaction and retention for our SaaS analytics platform. By understanding satisfaction levels across different segments, identifying key drivers of satisfaction, and assessing retention risks, we can prioritize product improvements and strategic initiatives to enhance customer experience and reduce churn. This plan will help us identify underperforming segments, correlate feature usage with satisfaction, and understand demographic patterns, ultimately supporting data-driven business decisions to improve our product offering and customer loyalty.
